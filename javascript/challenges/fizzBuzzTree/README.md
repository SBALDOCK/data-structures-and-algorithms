# Fizz Buzz Tree - Code Challenge - 17

* Write a function which takes a K-ary tree and determine whether or not the node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 

## Challenge Features
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. * * Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
* If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
* If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
* If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Testing Requirements

## Approach & Efficiency
* Adding a new node in the right place on a Binary Tree is O(n).
