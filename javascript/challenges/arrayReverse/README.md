# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
* Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
* I decided to approach this challenge with a for loop, starting from the end of the array and using "push" to assign each array[i] to a new array in order. This reversed the order of the original array. 

## Solution
