## Insertion Sort - Challenge 26


## Challenge Task 
Review the pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.


## Testing Requirements
* 

## Approach & Efficiency
* O(n)

## Insertion Sort

## Big O
  * Time Complexity - `O(n^2)`
  * Space Complexity - `O(1)`
